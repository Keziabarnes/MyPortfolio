        <h2>My Summary of The Twelve Pillars Chapters 4-7</h2>
        <p>In Chapters 4 through 7 of Twelve Pillars, I learned four powerful lessons that can transform my life. 
            Chapter 4 taught me that goals are not just about achieving destinations but about who I become in the process, 
            writing down my goals and breaking them into manageable steps that will shape my character and discipline. 
            Chapter 5 revealed that I must choose between the pain of discipline now or the pain of regret later,
            every day is expensive, so I must focus on what's truly important rather than what's merely urgent. 
            Chapter 6 challenged me to carefully evaluate my associations, recognizing that the people I surround myself with either 
            lift me toward my goals or pull me away from them. Finally, Chapter 7 emphasized that formal education makes a living, 
            but self-education makes a fortune,becoming a lifelong learner through reading, observing successful people, and reflecting 
            on my experiences is essential</p>
